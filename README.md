## 🌟 Project Highlights

* ✅ Clean **Eclipse-standard project structure**
* ✅ Clear separation of **Model, Service, and Main class**
* ✅ Demonstrates **real-world library workflow**
* ✅ Simple logic with **high readability**
* ✅ Ideal for **college submission, viva, and interviews**

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a **core Java, console-based application** that demonstrates how real-world library operations can be implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The project focuses on clarity, structure, and practical understanding rather than complex frameworks, making it perfect for beginners.

The application follows a **layered design approach** where data representation, business logic, and execution flow are separated into different classes. This approach is widely used in **industry-level Java applications**.

### 🎯 Real-Life Context

Libraries in **schools, colleges, universities, and public institutions** rely on software systems to manage books, records, and services. Popular systems like **Koha Library System** and **Libsys** use similar object-oriented designs at a much larger scale. This project acts as a **mini version** of such systems.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept                   | How It Is Used                         | Real-Life Mapping                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🧬 Class & Object         | Library entities created using classes | Book records in a real library    |
| 🛡️ Encapsulation         | Data accessed through methods          | Secure access to library records  |
| 🧱 Separation of Concerns | Model, Service, Main separated         | Industry-standard software design |

## 📝 Class Responsibilities

### 🔹 Library.java (Model Class)

* Stores library or book-related data
* Acts as a data container

**Industry Example:**
Similar to entity classes used in **library databases**.

---

### 🔹 Library_Service.java (Service Layer)

* Contains business logic
* Handles operations on library data

**Industry Example:**
Works like a backend service in real library automation systems.

---

### 🔹 LibraryApp.java (Main Class)

* Entry point of the application
* Connects model and service layers

**Industry Example:**
Acts like a controller or application runner.
